# OVERVIEW  

The File Integrity Checker is a Python-based tool designed to monitor changes in files by calculating and comparing their hash values. By leveraging cryptographic hash functions like SHA256, this tool can ensure the integrity of critical files. It's particularly useful for detecting unauthorized modifications in system logs, configuration files, or sensitive documents.

# Platform and Editor Used

This project was developed using:

* *Platform* : Windows 11

* *Editor*: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a powerful and user-friendly code editor.

# Tools Used

* *Python 3.9*: The primary programming language used.

* *Git*: For version control and repository management.

* *Command Prompt/Terminal*: To execute Python scripts and Git commands.

# Libraries Installed

The following Python libraries were used:

* *hashlib*: For calculating hash values of files (part of the standard library, no installation required).

* os : For interacting with the file system (also part of the standard library).

# Tools Installed

To set up and execute the project, the following were installed:

* *Python 3.x*: Downloaded and installed from the official Python website.

* *VS Code*: Installed as the primary code editor from the official VS Code website.

* *Git*: Installed for managing version control from Git's official website.


# Steps to Run the Code

Step 1 : Clone the Repository

          git clone https://github.com/shivakasula48/FILE-INTEGRITY-CHECKER.git

Step 2 : Navigate to the Project Directory

          cd FILE-INTEGRITY-CHECKER

Step 3 :Run the Script

          python file_integrity_checker.py

Step 4: Monitor Files:

Add files to the directory for monitoring.
The script will calculate and compare hash values to detect changes.

# How It Works
1.Hash Calculation:

* The script computes a hash value for each file using the SHA256 algorithm.

2.Change Detection:

* By comparing current hash values with previously stored values, the tool identifies any modifications.

# Use Cases

The File Integrity Checker can be applied in various scenarios:

1.System Security:

* Monitor critical system files to detect unauthorized modifications.

2.Data Integrity:

* Verify the integrity of backup files during or after transfer.

3.Compliance:

* Ensure compliance with security standards that require regular file integrity checks.

4.Forensics:

* Detect tampering with logs or evidence files in cybersecurity investigations.

# Steps to Build the Project

1.Understand the Basics:

* Familiarize yourself with cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA256).

2.Setup the Environment:

* Install Python and VS Code.

* Set up Git for version control.

3.Code Development:

* Write the script for hash calculation and comparison.

* Add functionality for real-time monitoring.

4.Testing:

* Use sample files to test for accurate change detection.

# Future Improvements

1.GUI Interface:

* Add a graphical interface for easier usability.

2.Real-Time Monitoring:

* Use file system event listeners to detect changes as they occur.

3.Hash Algorithms:

* Support additional hash functions like MD5, SHA1, or SHA512.
